MobFixer;  minecraft plugin

this plugin gives admins the option to decrease the amount of health that monsters start with and the amount of damage they do.

the reason for this is because i noticed that even on the easiest difficulty, mobs are just too much of a hassle to deal with. for example, it took 7 hits with an iron sword to kill a skeleton. tediously having to mow down groups of zombies just gets in the way of enjoying the game.
